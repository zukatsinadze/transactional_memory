# CS-453 - Course project

The [project description](https://dcl.epfl.ch/site/_media/education/ca-project.pdf) is available on [Moodle](https://moodle.epfl.ch/course/view.php?id=14334) and the [website of the course](https://dcl.epfl.ch/site/education/ca_2021).

The description includes:
* an introduction to (software) transactional memory
* an introduction to concurrent programming in C11/C++11, with pointers to more resources
* the _specifications_ of the transactional memory you have to implement, i.e. both:
  * sufficient properties for a transactional memory to be deemed _correct_
  * a thorough description of the transactional memory interface
* practical informations, including:
  * how to test your implementation on your local machine and on the evaluation server
  * how your submission will be graded
  * rules for (optionally) using 3rd-party libraries and collaboration (although the project is _individual_)
